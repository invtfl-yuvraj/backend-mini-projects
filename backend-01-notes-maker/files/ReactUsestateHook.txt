The useState hook in React is a fundamental tool for managing state in functional components. It allows you to add state to a component by declaring a state variable and a function to update it. When you use useState, you provide an initial value for the state variable, and React ensures that the component re-renders whenever the state changes. For example, you can use useState to track a counter by declaring a state variable like const [count, setCount] = useState(0). Here, count holds the current state value, and setCount is the function used to update it. You can then modify the state by calling setCount with a new value, such as setCount(count + 1). This allows React to update the user interface automatically based on the updated state. The useState hook is simple yet powerful, making it an essential tool for building interactive React applications.
