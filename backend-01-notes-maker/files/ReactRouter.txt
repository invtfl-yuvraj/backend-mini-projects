React routing is a key concept used to build single-page applications (SPAs), enabling smooth navigation between different views or pages without refreshing the browser. React Router is the most popular library for implementing routing, providing components like BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link, and NavLink to manage navigation. BrowserRouter wraps the entire application to enable routing functionality, Routes acts as a container for route definitions, and Route specifies a path and the component to render for that path. Link is used to navigate between routes without triggering a page reload, ensuring a seamless user experience. For example, you can set up routing by wrapping your app in BrowserRouter and defining paths like "/" for the home page, "/about" for an about page, and "/contact" for a contact page, linking them using the Link component. This approach makes it easy to manage multiple views within a React app efficiently.
